# blossom

The code of web applications can be divided between _product_ and _platform_. Product code solves
end user problems; platform code enables correct and efficient delivery. Product code differs
greatly between applications, but platform code can often be reused. This repository contains my
generalizable platform code for web applications; boilerplate in essence.

Each of the libraries consisting the platform tightly integrate with each other to eliminate
friction during product delivery.

This repository contains a superset of features; most applications will find some of them
unnecessary. It is intended that features be cherry-picked and copy-pasted from this repository into
specific projects.

- Component Stories: Ladle
- Test Runner: Vitest
- Visual Test Runner: Playwright & Ladle
- E2E Test Runner: Playwright (TODO)
  
Features:

- [Light and dark themes](./frontend/foundation/theme).
- [RPC framework](./frontend/foundation/rpc) with imperative, Jotai, and Tanstack Query bindings.
- [Custom errors](./frontend/foundation/errors) with rich metadata and stacktraces.
- [Icons](./frontend/foundation/icons) with tokenized colors and sizes, and lazy-loading.
- [Forms](./frontend/foundation/forms) for convenience.
- [Page layout primitives](./frontend/foundation/layout) optimizing consistency and flexibility.
- [Loader components](./frontend/foundation/loaders) for easy loading states.
- [Page routing](./frontend/foundation/routing) with code splitting and prefetching.
- [RPC mocks](./frontend/foundation/testing) with msw for Ladle stories and Vitest testing.

## Design

The design system currently has some random colors and fonts. Each application should change them.

- [Figma Tokens file](./frontend/foundation/theme).
- Figma component library.
- Figma color palette & theme libraries.

# Environment Setup

We use Nix to manage developer environments. All tools we use are declaratively defined in `nix/`.
To bootstrap the developer environment and get started:

1. Follow the [Linux](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Nix_Installation_Guide) or
   [MacOS](https://github.com/LnL7/nix-darwin) guide to install Nix.
2. [Enable Nix Flakes](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes#Enable_flakes).
3. [Install `direnv`](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Development_environment_with_nix-shell#direnv) and run
   `direnv allow` in the root of the monorepo.

After installing Nix and activating the developer environment, all tools and commands should work.

# Monorepo Organization

The monorepo is organized at the top-level by service type. Examples of service types are frontend,
backend, nix, and nomad. Each service type has its own internal organization.

## Application Services

The application services (the backend and frontend services) are organized as packages. Each package
solves one class of problems or feature and contains a README that document its purpose, context,
and usage.

Packages are sorted into _package groups_. While every application service will have its own set of
package groups, mainstays are:

- `foundation/` contains platform packages.
- `product/` contains the product packages.
- `codegen/` contains the packages that are produced from codegen tooling.

Inside each package group, packages are arranged in a flat structure. All package directories are
direct children of a package group directory.

_Note: The platform packages live in `foundation` instead of `platform` because
`platform` is a Python standard library package._

## Infrastructure

Infrastructure is structured similarly. The top level is organized by type of infrastructure.

- `flake.nix` aggregates all of Nix outputs derivations into a single flake.
- `docker-compose.yaml` defines all services used in the local environment.
- `nix/` contains Nix derivations for our packages, toolchains, and builds.
- `nomad/` contains Nomad service definitions.
- `.github/workflows/` contains the CI/CD pipeline configurations.

# Developer Port Space

We try to avoid having multiple local services occupy the same port. The current allocations of
services -> ports are:

- 40851: Backend
- 40852: Postgres
- 40853: Frontend
- 40854: Ladle
- 40855: Visual Tests
