tables:
  users:
    password_hash: This column is a hex value. It is null if a user's signup_step is `created` and not null if the signup step is `complete`.
    signup_step: When a user is invited, they are in step `created` with an invite attached to them. Only when a user finishes signing up do they switch to step `complete`.
    is_enabled: Whether or not the user can access the product. Generally, this is meant to be used to remove access from product.users that violate an internal policy or have nefarious intents.
  invites:
    code_hash: This column is a hex value.
    expires_at: If this time is in the past, it means the invite has expired. Do a 14 day expiration window I personally take _forever_ to sign up for a SaaS.
    accepted_at: If this is not null, it means this invite was accepted.
  organizations_users:
    removed_at: If this is not null, it means the user was removed from the organization at this time.
