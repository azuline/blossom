          In the Northern Ocean there is a fish called Kun which is many thousand li in size. It
          changes into a bird named Peng whose back is many thousand li in breadth. When it rises
          and flies, its wings are like clouds filling the sky. When this bird moves across the
          ocean, it heads for the South Sea, the Celestial Lake.{" "}
          <Link href="/">
            In Chi Hsieh’s record of wonders it says: “When Peng is heading toward the Southern
            Ocean it splashes along the water for three thousand li. It rises with the wind and
            wings its way up to ninety thousand li; it flies for six months, and then it rests.”
          </Link>{" "}
          Heat shimmers in the air like galloping horses, dust floats like the morning mist, and
          living creatures are blown about in the sky. The sky is blue. Is that really so? Or does
          it only look blue because it stretches off into infinity? When Peng looks down from above,
          it will also seem blue.{" "}

            A large boat draws a great deal of water. Pour a cup of water into a hollow in the
            ground, and a mustard seed can float there like a little ship. Place the cup in it, and
            it will not move, because the water is shallow and the boat is large. Only at a certain
            height is there enough air space for a great wingspan.
          </Link>{" "}
          So Peng rises to ninety thousand li, and there is enough air below him. Then he mounts the
          wind, and with the blue sky at his back, and nothing in his way, he heads for the south.
