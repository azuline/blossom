          VisuallyHidden renders an element yet hides it from the screen. Screen readers will still
          pick up the element.

          VisuallyHidden is primarily used for accessibility. VisuallyHidden can also be used to
          eager-load lazy-loaded elements by rendering the lazy-loaded element inside
          VisuallyHidden.
