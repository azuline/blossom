# Doing Things

See the `Makefile` for a list of common dev tool commands.

This directory contains a multipackage setup with the Turborepo monorepo build
tool. For the best developer experience:

1. Run `make install` whenever the `dependencies` change in a `package.json`.
2. Run `make typewatch` in a shell when developing. This protects you from
   seeing stale types from old code.
3. Run `make start` to run dev servers for the app and the stories.

# Directories

- `codegen/` contains the outputs of codegen systems.
- `configs/` contains tooling configurations shared between packages.
